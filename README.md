# IP-retrieve-cpp
A try out cpp program (retrieve IP address) to show cpp development (for myself)

## Install LLVM/Clang
### Download 
[LLVM-Release](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases)   
Download the binary for windows: LLVM-15.0.6-win64.exe
### Install
Remember to select to add to `PATH`

## Standard Library
TODO: NEED TO COMFIRM

I installed Visual Studio beforehand so library (like `<iostream>`) may come with the `MSCV` in it

The C++ standard library is typically provided as a separate package from the compiler, and LLVM is a compiler infrastructure, not a compiler itself. LLVM does not include a C++ standard library.

## Compile/Build
### Simple Hello world
`clang test.cpp` will get you executable `a.exe`
